# Betting in the NFL - Project Summary
With the rise of sports betting becoming more accessible through electronic devices such as phones, the concept of sports betting has become a more popular form of gambling across the United States. People love to try to get money from sports, especially ones that interest them as they believe it is an easy way to make some money. This is an interesting topic as we can see how betting books came up with ways to make betting lines and what factors come into play when they make them. The sports books have an important job when it comes to figuring out where to set lines, since their jobs are to not let gamblers take too much of their money.  Therefore, lots of research and effort goes into the different lines that are set.  By exploring these lines and the trends that are associated with them, we can hopefully figure out how some of the thought processes into how these lines are set, and the different ways games play out accordingly.
